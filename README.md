# Needleman-Wunsh algorithm

This repository contain a python script use to align nucleotidic sequences or amino acid sequences with the **Needleman & Wunsh** algortihm.
It is also possible to do a local alignment with nucleotidic sequences.

This script is my first python project made in 2020. Of course, some improvement have to be done.

### Usage :
`python3 NW_LEONFOUNLIN_RAVY.py file.fasta`
The result is display on the terminal.
